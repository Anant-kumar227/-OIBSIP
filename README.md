Welcome To My Project,

About my Tasks:
I have completed level 2 of the internship and my tasks are:

Task 1: Calculator

In this task, I built a calculator using HTML, CSS, JS . I used VScode as my IDE. in this task, i gained knowledge about various HTML tags and also learned to create good looking designs using CSS.

Task 2: Tribute Page

In this task, I built a Tribute Page using HTML . I used VScode as my IDE. This is a fairly simple task compared to other two as it didn’t involve any JavaScript. The tribute page was about Apple Co-founder, Steve Jobs.

Task 3: A Basic To-Do Webapp

In this task, I built this using HTML. I used VScode as my IDE.
Finally, I want to express my gratitude to the team at Oasis Infobyte for providing me with this fantastic chance to advance my web development abilities.

Task4 : Login authentication
Create a simple login authentication system using a programming language of your choice (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java, etc.) that allows users to register, login, and access a secured page.

It was a very amazing experience. I’m happy to be a member of OASIS INFOBYTE, a lovely and outstanding organisation.
